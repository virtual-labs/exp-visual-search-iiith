## Procedure
1) Participants will log in to the virtual lab site and read the instructions for the visual search experiment.
2) The experiment will consist of multiple trials, each presenting a visual display of objects on the screen.
3) In the singleton search trials, participants will be asked to search for a target object that differs from the distractors by a single feature, such as color. They will indicate the presence or absence of the target by clicking a corresponding button.
4) In the conjunctive search trials, participants will be asked to search for a target object defined by a combination of features, such as color and shape. Again, they will indicate the presence or absence of the target.
5) The experiment will include varying set sizes (number of objects in the display) and target-distractor similarity to examine the impact on search performance.
6) Response times and accuracy will be recorded for each trial.
7) After completing the trials, participants will receive feedback on their performance, including their search times and accuracy.
